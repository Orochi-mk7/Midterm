Code Explanation

Dataset Loading:
NSL-KDD dataset is loaded into the code

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

The code examines the 'protocol_type' column to understand the unique network protocols present in the dataset. Any unexpected values in this column are handled by replacing them with 'unknown' to maintain data consistency.
Encoding Categorical Data:

The 'protocol_type' column, representing categorical data, is manually encoded into numerical values. This transformation is essential for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.
Label Encoding:

Other categorical columns, such as 'service', 'flag', and 'label', are encoded using scikit-learn's LabelEncoder. This ensures that all categorical data is represented numerically, preparing it for model training.
Data Splitting:

Assuming the dataset contains a column named 'label' representing the intrusion labels, the data is split into features (X) and labels (y). The dataset is then further divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
RandomForest Classifier Creation and Training:

A RandomForest classifier is created, a machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in classification tasks. This classifier is trained using the training set, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
Model Prediction:

The trained RandomForest classifier is used to predict labels for the test set. This step evaluates how well the model generalizes to unseen data, which is crucial for assessing its real-world performance.
Performance Evaluation:

The code calculates the accuracy of the model by comparing its predictions with the actual labels in the test set. Additionally, a detailed classification report is generated, providing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. These metrics offer insights into how well the model performs on different types of network activities
